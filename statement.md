Statement of the Project: Image Classification using MobileNet & MobileNetV2:-

#Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of digital images and multimedia data, identifying objects manually from images has become time-consuming and inefficient. There is a need for an automated system capable of accurately classifying images into predefined categories. This project aims to develop an image classification model using deep learning techniques and pretrained architectures such as MobileNet and MobileNetV2 to recognize the content of an input image effectively.
#Scope of the Project
The project focuses on implementing image classification using pretrained models from TensorFlow/Keras.
It covers loading, preprocessing, and predicting the class of an image using deep learning.
The scope includes using lightweight yet powerful models suitable for real-time and mobile-based applications.
It demonstrates practical understanding of transfer learning and inference using pre-trained CNN models.
The project does not include training models from scratch or building large datasets; it strictly uses pretrained ImageNet-trained models.

#Target Users
Students learning Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Computer Vision.
Researchers and learners who want a basic code-level understanding of image classification.
Developers looking to integrate lightweight image recognition models into mobile or embedded systems.
Educators who need a simple project example for teaching CNNs and pretrained models.

#High-Level Features
Utilizes MobileNet and MobileNetV2 models trained on ImageNet.
Performs accurate classification on input images of size 224 × 224 × 3.
Preprocesses images automatically to match model requirements.
Outputs Top-5 predicted labels with probability scores.
Allows easy replacement of input images for testing different objects.
Uses minimal system resources due to lightweight model architecture.
Provides clear visualization of the input image using Matplotlib.
