Imageclassification:-
This projects is about image classification with help of programming languages , it reads an image and describes it. 
It performs image sorting using two pre-trained deep learning models ie, MobileNet and MobileNetV2, it
loads an image,and then  processes it into the format as required by the model, then proceed further to predict the most likely object present in the image using ImageNet label mappings.Also demonstrates multiple ways to load an image using different libraries, which is begginner friendly.

Features:-
Uses pre-trained MobileNet & MobileNetV2 models
Classifies any input image using ImageNet categories
Works without training since models are pre-loaded.

Tools to be implemented:-
Python,Numpy,Matplotlib,Pillow,ImageNet Utilities,TensorFlow or Keras.

Steps to install & run the project:-
Install the Required Packages 
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python pillow matplotlib
Add an Image
filename = "dog.jpg" 
Run the Project 
python image_classification.py 
To Test the Program 
Replace dog.jpg with any other image.
