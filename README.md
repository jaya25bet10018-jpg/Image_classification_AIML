# Image_classification_
This projects is about image classification with help of programming languages , it reads an image and describes it. 
It performs image sorting using two pre-trained deep learning models ie, MobileNet and MobileNetV2, it
loads an image,and then  processes it into the format as required by the model, then proceed further to predict the most likely object present in the image using ImageNet label mappings.Also demonstrates multiple ways to load an image using different libraries, which is begginner friendly.
